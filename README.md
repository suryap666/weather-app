### Project details

This application can be used by a weather enthusiast to find out the number of days when the temperature is above 20 degrees celsius and whether it is sunny on those days in a particular city

### How to use

Open the web page : [https://suryap666.github.io/weather-app/#/](https://suryap666.github.io/weather-app/#/)
Search for a city in the search field in upper right corner and press Enter key. For example, Sydney.
This will give the weather forecast for upcoming 7 days.
_ Sunny days are highlighted in white color.
_ Days where temperature is above 20°C are highlighted in orange.
_ Days which are sunny with a temperature above 20°C are highlighted in red-white gradient.
_ All other days (temperature less than 20°C and not sunny) have blue background.
_ Tiles for individual days present the average temperature on that particular day.
_ Click on the tile to get temperature for that time of the day (morning/afternoon/evening/night).

### Project Dependencies and build steps

- Install Node

- If you prefer, you can use yarn as the package manager.

### Available Scripts

Check out the project and can run the below commands

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
